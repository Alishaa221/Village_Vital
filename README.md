# Village Vital  
**Smart Community Health Monitoring and Early Warning System**

---

## 📌 Overview
Village Vital is a **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** project focused on the early detection and prevention of water-borne disease outbreaks in rural and tribal regions of Northeast India. The system combines community health reporting, water quality monitoring, and AI-driven analysis to support timely public health interventions.

The platform enables grassroots health workers and community members to report symptoms and water conditions, while providing health authorities with real-time insights, alerts, and dashboards to identify emerging disease hotspots.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A are prevalent in rural Northeast India due to contaminated water sources, seasonal effects, and limited access to healthcare. Delayed reporting and response often worsen outbreak severity. This project addresses the need for a unified digital surveillance and early warning system.
